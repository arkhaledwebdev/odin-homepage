        Salah ad-Din was a prominent Muslim military leader and the founder of
        the Ayyubid dynasty. Born in 1137 or 1138 in Tikrit, Mesopotamia, he is
        best known for his role in the Crusades, particularly for recapturing
        Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. His leadership, military prowess,
        and chivalry earned him respect from both his Muslim followers and his
        Christian adversaries. Saladin's reign marked a significant period of
        consolidation and expansion in the Muslim world, and he is celebrated
        for his efforts to unite the Muslim territories and his just and
        honorable conduct. He died in 1193 in Damascus, leaving a legacy as one
        of the most admired figures in both Islamic and Western history.
